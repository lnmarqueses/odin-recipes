    <p> A traditional pork dish from Spain, lech처n is a suckling pig that's roasted. The pig is the star here, so make sure you properly source it. This home adaptation of a classic pig roast offers all the flavors you want in any pork product but is spiked with the delicious citrus-herbiness of the mojo. You can make the mojo up to 3 days ahead. You'll need an injection needle which can be found in the BBQ section of grocery stores.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>20 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (15- to 18-lb.) whole suckling pig</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li> Place garlic, cilantro, oregano, salt, pepper, cumin, and 1/2 cup of the oil in a blender. Slowly add orange and lime juice, and pulse until smooth, 10 to 12 times. Remove 1 cup marinade mixture, and reserve for later use.</li>
        <li>Place pig in a container that is large enough to accommodate its size. Thoroughly coat with remaining marinade mixture, rubbing all over pig. Cover container, and chill 8 to 24 hours, basting occasionally.</li>
        <li> Preheat oven to 275째F. Place a wire rack in a large, aluminum foil-lined rimmed baking sheet or roasting pan. Remove pig from marinade, and place on rack, discarding marinade.</li>
        <li> Inject pig all over with reserved 1 cup marinade mixture, and rub with remaining 1 cup oil. Roast pig in preheated oven until a meat thermometer inserted into the shoulder joint close to the head registers 160째F, about 4 hours, rotating pan, if necessary. Increase oven temperature to 425째F, and roast until skin is golden brown and crispy, about 1 hour. Let rest 20 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
